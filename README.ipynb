    "\n",
    "The BB84 protocol utilizes the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics and a set of conjugate polarization states of light in order to generate a one time secret key, also known as a `one time pad`, that can be used to communicate securely. The destructive nature of quantum measurements ensures that anyone trying to eavesdrop on this key generation will have a high probability of disrupting the key generation process and thus be detected.\n",
